We replicated the proposed quantum algorithm in the paper [Quantum algorithm for a chemical reaction path optimization by using a variational quantum algorithm and a reaction path generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06803). We have reproduced the result of three of the images as follows.

![Fig 1.](https://github.com/yangguohao/QHACK2023/blob/main/71083F82-195B-4f99-9B8D-4FB5B80AE66D.png)

As shown in the figure, we have obtained the results of atomic bond length and force convergence that are similar to the results of the paper.

There are still some deficiencies

(1) The article uses the central difference method, which consumes a lot of time. There are much more extension that could be done.

(2) Due to time constraints, only one of the results was reproduced.
